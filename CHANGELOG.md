# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Restructured EML parsing around a real PSI tree (headers, header blocks, MIME parts, nested
  `message/rfc822` messages). Folding now follows the structural tree instead of name-based
  boundary pairing, which removes a class of edge-case issues with nested MIME parts.
- Header annotator now resolves the header name via the parent `EmlHeader` element rather than
  walking PSI siblings, removing an O(n) cost on long folded headers.
- Content-Type parsing handles folded continuations and quoted/escaped parameter values.

### Added

- RFC 2047 encoded-word decoding for header values (`=?UTF-8?Q?…?=` / `=?…?B?…?=`).
- Test coverage for `EmlSyntaxHighlighterFactory`, the RFC 2047 decoder, the PSI parser,
  and edge cases: missing terminator boundaries, nested `message/rfc822` with CRLF,
  BOM-prefixed content, and RFC 2047 encoded subjects.

### Fixed

- Header highlighting now covers per-part MIME headers and nested `message/rfc822` attachments (#27)
- `EmlBoundaryParser` now logs duplicate boundary declarations at debug level instead of
  silently merging them.
- Newly added headers now appear in the Color Scheme page immediately after Apply, without
  needing to reopen the Settings dialog.
